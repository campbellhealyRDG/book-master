  chapters: Chapter[]
  selectedChapter: Chapter | null
  loading: boolean
  error: string | null
}
```

### API Integration
- **Book Management**: `/api/books` endpoints
- **Chapter Management**: `/api/books/:bookId/chapters` endpoints
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states with retry logic
- **Caching**: Intelligent caching of book and chapter data
