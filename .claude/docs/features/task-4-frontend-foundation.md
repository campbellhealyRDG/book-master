### State Management Architecture
```typescript
interface AppState {
  // Data state
  books: Book[]
  chapters: Chapter[]
  dictionaryTerms: DictionaryTerm[]
  userPreferences: Record<string, unknown>
  scratchpad: Scratchpad | null
  
  // UI state
  sidebarCollapsed: boolean
  loading: boolean
  errors: AppError[]
  
  // Editor state
  unsavedChanges: boolean
  autoSaveEnabled: boolean
  spellCheckEnabled: boolean
  
  // Actions for all state mutations
}
```
