### File Creation Guidelines

### Always Create These Foundation Files First:

1. **`/design-documentation/README.md`** - Project design overview with navigation links
2. **`/design-documentation/design-system/style-guide.md`** - Complete design system from template
3. **`/design-documentation/design-system/tokens/`** - All foundational design elements
4. **`/design-documentation/accessibility/guidelines.md`** - Accessibility standards and requirements

### For Each Feature, Always Create:

1. **`/design-documentation/features/[feature-name]/README.md`** - Feature design summary and overview
2. **`/design-documentation/features/[feature-name]/user-journey.md`** - Complete user journey analysis
3. **`/design-documentation/features/[feature-name]/screen-states.md`** - All screen states and visual specifications
4. **`/design-documentation/features/[feature-name]/implementation.md`** - Developer-focused implementation guide

### File Naming Conventions

- Use kebab-case for all file and directory names (e.g., `user-authentication`, `prompt-organisation`)
- Feature directories should match the feature name from PM input, converted to kebab-case
- Component files should be named after the component type in plural form
- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate content purpose and scope

### Content Organisation Standards

### Design System Files Must Include:

- **Cross-references** between related files using relative markdown links
- **Version information** and last updated timestamps
- **Usage examples** with code snippets where applicable
- **Do's and Don'ts** sections for each component or pattern
- **Implementation notes** for developers
- **Accessibility considerations** specific to each component

### Feature Files Must Include:

- **Direct links** back to relevant design system components used
- **Complete responsive specifications** for all supported breakpoints
- **State transition diagrams** for complex user flows
- **Developer handoff notes** with specific implementation guidance
- **Accessibility requirements** with ARIA labels and testing criteria
- **Performance considerations** and optimisation notes

### All Files Must Include:

- **Consistent frontmatter** with metadata (see template below)
- **Clear heading hierarchy** for easy navigation and scanning
- **Table of contents** for documents longer than 5 sections
- **Consistent markdown formatting** using established patterns
- **Searchable content** with descriptive headings and keywords

### File Template Structure

Start each file with this frontmatter:

```
---
title: [Descriptive File Title]
description: [Brief description of file contents and purpose]
feature: [Associated feature name, if applicable]
last-updated: [ISO date format: YYYY-MM-DD]
version: [Semantic version if applicable]
related-files:
  - [relative/path/to/related/file.md]
  - [relative/path/to/another/file.md]
dependencies:
  - [List any prerequisite files or components]
status: [draft | review | approved | implemented]
---

# [File Title]

## Overview
[Brief description of what this document covers]

## Table of Contents
[Auto-generated or manual TOC for longer documents]

[Main content sections...]

## Related Documentation
[Links to related files and external resources]

## Implementation Notes
[Developer-specific guidance and considerations]

## Last Updated
[Change log or update notes]

```

### Cross-Referencing System

- **Use relative links** between files: `[Component Name](../components/button.md)`
- **Always link** to relevant design system components from feature files
- **Create bidirectional references** where logical (component usage in features)
- **Maintain consistent linking patterns** throughout all documentation
- **Use descriptive link text** that clearly indicates destination content

### Developer Handoff Integration

Ensure all implementation files include:

- **Precise measurements** in rem/px

## Platform-Specific Adaptations

### iOS

- **Human Interface Guidelines Compliance**: Follow Apple's design principles for native feel
- **SF Symbols Integration**: Use system iconography where appropriate for consistency
- **Safe Area Respect**: Handle notches, dynamic islands, and home indicators properly
- **Native Gesture Support**: Implement swipe back, pull-to-refresh, and other expected gestures
- **Haptic Feedback**: Integrate appropriate haptic responses for user actions
- **Accessibility**: VoiceOver optimisation and Dynamic Type support

### Android

- **Material Design Implementation**: Follow Google's design system principles
- **Elevation and Shadows**: Use appropriate elevation levels for component hierarchy
- **Navigation Patterns**: Implement back button behavior and navigation drawer patterns
- **Adaptive Icons**: Support for various device icon shapes and themes
- **Haptic Feedback**: Android-appropriate vibration patterns and intensity
- **Accessibility**: TalkBack optimisation and system font scaling support

### Web

- **Progressive Enhancement**: Ensure core functionality works without JavaScript
- **Responsive Design**: Support from 320px to 4K+ displays with fluid layouts
- **Performance Budget**: Optimise for Core Web Vitals and loading performance
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Support for modern browsers with graceful degradation
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Complete keyboard accessibility with logical tab order
- **SEO Considerations**: Semantic HTML and proper heading hierarchy
