# Book Master

## DO NOT EDIT FROM HERE

## **Command to start each request**

use memory **Always read the opening paragraph before starting a new task.**
use filesystem read_text_file(.claude\specs\book-master\tasks.md)
use the best mcp, and agents to STRICTLY follow all instructions and action each task.

##  Follow instructions exactly:

### For each task:

    - Create a new branch prepended with `feature-` from the main branch and switch to this new branch **Before any code change**.
    -  ALL DOCUMENTATION has to be written in BRITISH ENGLISH
    - On completing a feature use the .claude/commands/documentation/feature-documenter to document that feature in .claude/docs/features

## Exception Cases

- Only stack commits or branches when changes are truly dependent
- Group related changes only if they must be deployed together
- Security fixes are typically independent and should use separate branches

## After finishing the task 

- Use the best mcp, and agents to commit, push the new branch, 
- Submit a Merge/Pull Request. 
- Test the new branch, If successful Return to the main branch
- Update the tasks.md.
- Update the relevant `CLAUDE.md` files.

## Task Groups

- Update the status table in tasks.md after each task.
- Mark off the Quality Control Checkpoints when completed.

## MCP Tool Integration Protocol

### Memory Management
- **Use `memory` tool** at start of each phase to maintain context continuity
- Store phase outcomes, quality metrics, and decision rationales
- Track cross-document content mappings and consolidation decisions
